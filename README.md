# Setup
A set of instructions for standardizing the code base used by the Brian Collins research group at Washington State University

## Software Installation
The group works with four main programming languages 
1. Igor Pro / Wave Metrics 
2. Python
3. C++/C/C#
4. MATLAB

In general, you should not install every one of these languages; only install the ones you will be working on and using. 

### Igor Pro 
For a detailed description of Igor Pro on-boarding, see the [Igor-Standard-Procs](https://github.com/WSU-Carbon-Lab/Igor-Standard-Procs) repository. For the basic installation, download [Igor Pro 8](https://www.wavemetrics.com/downloads/current) and follow the installation setup guide. 

 
### Python
Our group uses python versions 3+ and makes heavy use of virtual environments issuing the Anaconda package manager. To get started with python, go to the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) website and download the version for your current operating system. A more detailed description of onboarding for python development can be found in the [Python-Standard-Procs](https://github.com/WSU-Carbon-Lab/Python-Standard-Procs) repository. 


## C Languages
There is little code written in the C/C++/C# ecosystem, and as such we have no standard on-boarding procedures for it's development. It is recommended instead that you instead follow the installation directions provided by [Microsoft Visual Studios Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/introvideos-cpp) in getting started with C programming. 


### MATLAB
Similarly so, MATLAB is rarely used in our code base. As you need a license for installing MATLAB, you must download the application though the [WSU MATLAB Portal](https://its.wsu.edu/software-site-licenses/).
