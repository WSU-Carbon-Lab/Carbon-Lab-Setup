# Setup
A set of instructions for standardizing the code base used by the Brian Collins research group at Washington State University

## Software Installation
The group works with four main programming languages 
1. Igor Pro / Wave Metrics 
2. Python
3. C++/C/C#
4. MATLAB

In general, you should not install every one of these languages; only install the ones you will be working on and using. 
### Igot Pro 
For a detailed description of Igor Pro onboarding, see the [Igor-Standard-Procs](https://github.com/WSU-Carbon-Lab/Igor-Standard-Procs) repository. For the basic installation, download [Igor Pro 8](https://www.wavemetrics.com/downloads/current) and follow the installation setup guide.
